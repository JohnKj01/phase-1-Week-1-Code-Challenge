The projects described below are hosted in independent folders (folders in this respository) each containing: index.html (DOM), style.css(styling), index.js (script)

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem):
  The program prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 
  A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.
  
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
  The program takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70),
  it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
  Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee,the program calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
