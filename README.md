Week 1 Code Challenge
Due No Due Date Points 15 Submitting a website url Attempts 0 Allowed Attempts 3
Prerequisite

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.
2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.
3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
4. Submit the repository link for grading.
   Ensure your repository has a well written README.
   NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges. To structure your project, you can put each challenge in its own folder or different files in the same folder.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
